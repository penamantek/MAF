## Welcome to the Make-a-Friend Matchmaking System!

This program randomly pairs up Make-a-Friend club members. To do this, you would have to input the user members' names manually. The program would then output the randomly generated pairs.

The Make-a-Friend Matchmaking System is still a work-in-progress project with various potential bugs. There are many more features we are planning to implement, some of which include:
- Matchmaking pairs based on tutoring/mentoring needs
- Service hour tracking of each student
- Importing student names from CSV files

## Version 1.1

This is the initial release of the Make-a-Friend Matchmaking System. After many revisions, we've decided to simplify our program to serve its main purpose: generating random pairs of students.

To use this program, enter the number of people to be paired. Then, enter each member's name. Once you are finished, the program will generate random pairs and will display any leftover members.
